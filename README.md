# 🔊 Voice AI Agent for Telegram (n8n Automation)

A production-grade **Voice AI automation system** built using **n8n** and the **Telegram Bot API**.  
This agent listens to Telegram messages, processes them using AI, converts the responses into voice messages, and sends them back automatically.  
If messages remain unread, the system escalates the event via automated email notifications.

This repository reflects a **real-world automation architecture**, not a demo or tutorial workflow.
